# Rally Racing Spin Off
Team Queenie Xiang and Terry Guan PD 5

## Description of Project
The project is a two player game that draws inspiration from the classic rally racing game. One player, the driver, must navigate a set of directories until he/she finds the finish line. The other player, the guider, will have to solve questions as the driver navigates into new directories. Every time the driver enters a directory, a question is given to the guider who then has to answer it correctly. Upon answering it correctly, a hint will be given as to where the finish line is. The guider must then relay this information to the driver. The game continues until the driver reaches the finish line.
